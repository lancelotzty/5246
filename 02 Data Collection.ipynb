It's an amazing feeling I have, but I want to address the fact that I have substituted alcohol with working out. I find this bizarre, but cool at the same time.

Not long ago, people got excited about reports showing a decline in the number of people abusing prescription opiates. The real reason for the decline, however, was that people escalated their use from pills to heroin. In other words, news that was supposed to be good should actually have been a reason for alarm!\\n\\nAs [opioid treatment specialists](https://www.opiates.com/opioid-treatment/) for over 20 years, we see patients who fly in from all over the country. Lately, a large number of our heroin patients, especially from the east coast, have tested negative for opioids. What does that mean? It means we don't even know what is being sold on the streets as \"heroin.\" As similar as the euphoria is to a heroin high, the chemicals used are unknown. We are treating these patients in the hospital while preparing for very unusual withdrawal symptoms.\\n\\nSo when I see reports about a decline in addiction to a certain drug, I become wary of the news. Effective detoxification followed by accessible, individual mental health is still a rarity. Without that or other clear, positive factors to cause that decline, the real reason for the decline needs to be carefully identified.</td>\n",

       "1  Strange side effects, please give any advice. For roughly the past four years, I had not been able to go more than a few days without drinking. I drank pretty heavily, and also smoked a lot of pot.This began to affect my focus, which caused me to go on Adderall 2 years ago. I also smoked cigarettes pretty heavily. I'm recently, as of the past two months, completely sober of everything but marijuana, which I tried to quit a week ago. This is the longest I've ever gone without drinking as in every other time I tried to quit I barely lasted 3-4 days.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI wanted to discuss two side effects that are one bad and the other maybe bad/strange and definitely would like some of your advice on.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have never gone this long without using alcohol, by the way, the adderall and cigarettes are just an added bonus. It's an amazing feeling I have, but I want to address the fact that I have substituted alcohol with working out. I find this bizarre, but cool at the same time. I also experienced intense anger issues 3 days ago when I tried to quit marijuana.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI worked out for four hours straight one day.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHas anyone experienced any strange substitutions like this?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI guess my question to summarize, is do you, or is it common for people to experience weird substitutes and/or the intense anger that came three days ago when I tried to quit marijuana?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWeed's the last thing I need to quit.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI'm very proud of myself and don't want to screw this up. I've never felt or looked this amazing.  \n",

Not long ago, people got excited about reports showing a decline in the number of people abusing prescription opiates. The real reason for the decline, however, was that people escalated their use from pills to heroin. In other words, news that was supposed to be good should actually have been a reason for alarm!\\n\\nAs [opioid treatment specialists](https://www.opiates.com/opioid-treatment/) for over 20 years, we see patients who fly in from all over the country. Lately, a large number of our heroin patients, especially from the east coast, have tested negative for opioids. What does that mean? It means we don't even know what is being sold on the streets as \"heroin.\" As similar as the euphoria is to a heroin high, the chemicals used are unknown. We are treating these patients in the hospital while preparing for very unusual withdrawal symptoms.\\n\\nSo when I see reports about a decline in addiction to a certain drug, I become wary of the news. Effective detoxification followed by accessible, individual mental health is still a rarity. Without that or other clear, positive factors to cause that decline, the real reason for the decline needs to be carefully identified.  \n",

Outside of the classic MKUltra experiments with LSD and hypnosis and what not does anyone have any good videos or reads on different theories of potential substances that the elite mercenaries have access too?

It is incredibly alarming and hard to believe that the US government can do this, apparently even legally. \\n\\nI wonder if at this very moment our own online comments are being analyzed and some names submitted to be candidates for the killing list. Can you really fathom that this actually really may be happening? It is hard to believe but I think it is happening. \\n\\nTake good care my fellow concerned citizens. And may one day US elections be won by good people who really get to stop all the chaos, death and destruction that successive US administrations are bringing to the world. \\n\\n[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/05/obama-kill-list-doj-memo](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/05/obama-kill-list-doj-memo)  \n",

It’s clear that many companies grow uncorrupted. That’s just the result of capitalism. \\n\\nBut I’ve always wondered who owns the major media companies once they’ve grown. I mean, somebody is clearly trying to buy them out to further their agenda.\\n\\nI’m not referring to companies like CNN. I’m referring to Facebook, SnapChat, YouTube and so on. THESE are the media’s of the future. \\n\\nSometimes for fun I will go on Snapchat and look at the news stories that it shows. To me that indicates what kind of ideas they are trying to put in our minds.\\n\\nOf course, some companies aren’t going to sell out. Maybe Snapchat hasn’t. But it all just makes me wonder, who is buying out these companies? \\n\\n  \n",
       "4  [Discussion] Top Secret Pharmaceuticals Does anybody have any good sources for militarized (and/or elite) applications of pharmaceuticals?, We always hear about different secret technologies that the government/defense agencies are developing or sitting on; whether it be direct energy weapons/death rays, unconventional aircraft, weather modifications and the likes, but I rarely hear of any theories of pharma technologies that enhance the most important resource (arguably) in any military, the human being itself. Outside of the classic MKUltra experiments with LSD and hypnosis and what not does anyone have any good videos or reads on different theories of potential substances that the elite mercenaries have access too? Shit, I’d be interested in any resources that discuss the top secret alteration of biology in any kind of way to enhance the warrior. \\n\\nIt seems to me that an amphetamine style stimulant with some kind of sensory enhancing, but also pain numbing drug would be worth researching. We really don’t know the limits of pharmaceuticals. I don’t think it is so far-fetched to believe that there is a significant chunk of the black budget that goes towards developing these kinds of things for combat uses.\\n\\nWhat do y’all think? Have any theories of your own?  "
