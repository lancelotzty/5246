After watching countless annunaki videos on YouTube, I’ve concluded that the idea is mostly new age pseudoscience. Thinking of things rationally, the idea that a species that’s advanced enough to travel inter galactic-ally would come all the way here to engineer a slave race to mine for gold instead of simply using AI is ridiculous. Then deciding that their creation is so disobedient that they need to take them out with a flood, it just sounds like complete mythology to me. And the idea of their planet Nibiru rotating around two suns in the opposite direction, I feel it doesn’t reflect accurate astronomy at all. Why there definitely may be a large planet beyond Pluto somewhere, I don’t believe it’s more likely to have life than any others with an atmosphere similar to earth.\\n\\nI always consider all views but my belief is that if extra terrestrials are here already, it’s not related to the mainstream narrative that’s portrayed to the public.\\n\\nJust my opinion, other input is welcome.</td>\n",

       "0                                    My argument against the annunaki narrative One idea I’ve always toyed with is whether or not there is any truth to Zecharia Sitchin’s work pertaining to the idea that extraterrestrials have been manipulating our government since at least Sumerian times. After watching countless annunaki videos on YouTube, I’ve concluded that the idea is mostly new age pseudoscience. Thinking of things rationally, the idea that a species that’s advanced enough to travel inter galactic-ally would come all the way here to engineer a slave race to mine for gold instead of simply using AI is ridiculous. Then deciding that their creation is so disobedient that they need to take them out with a flood, it just sounds like complete mythology to me. And the idea of their planet Nibiru rotating around two suns in the opposite direction, I feel it doesn’t reflect accurate astronomy at all. Why there definitely may be a large planet beyond Pluto somewhere, I don’t believe it’s more likely to have life than any others with an atmosphere similar to earth.\\n\\nI always consider all views but my belief is that if extra terrestrials are here already, it’s not related to the mainstream narrative that’s portrayed to the public.\\n\\nJust my opinion, other input is welcome.   \n",

It was revealed during the Obama administration that the US government had an assassination program, which was used to find and kill US citizens,  including a 16-year-old, who were suspected members of military adversaries. It is incredibly alarming and hard to believe that the US government can do this, apparently even legally. \\n\\nI wonder if at this very moment our own online comments are being analyzed and some names submitted to be candidates for the killing list. Can you really fathom that this actually really may be happening? It is hard to believe but I think it is happening. \\n\\nTake good care my fellow concerned citizens.

       "4      [Discussion] Top Secret Pharmaceuticals Does anybody have any good sources for militarized (and/or elite) applications of pharmaceuticals?, We always hear about different secret technologies that the government/defense agencies are developing or sitting on; whether it be direct energy weapons/death rays, unconventional aircraft, weather modifications and the likes, but I rarely hear of any theories of pharma technologies that enhance the most important resource (arguably) in any military, the human being itself. Outside of the classic MKUltra experiments with LSD and hypnosis and what not does anyone have any good videos or reads on different theories of potential substances that the elite mercenaries have access too? Shit, I’d be interested in any resources that discuss the top secret alteration of biology in any kind of way to enhance the warrior. \\n\\nIt seems to me that an amphetamine style stimulant with some kind of sensory enhancing, but also pain numbing drug would be worth researching.

In the future when my father is no longer around I think I will have no choice but to end my life. I’m so scared. I wish more than anything that I will just go to sleep and not wake up. I hate being alive.   \n",

I thought i was finally reaching the point where it got better for me, but it's all coming crashing down. I'm in a very very low point of my life. \\n\\nI feel like the only option to end this suffering is suicide.\\n\\nI don't know why I'm posting this here. Maybe I just want someone to listen....maybe I want someone to know how much I was hurting before I finally ended it.\\n\\nThank you for reading. I'm sorry to inconvenience.   \n",

       "0                         my argument against the annunaki narrative one idea i have always toyed with is whether or not there is any truth to zecharia sitchin s work pertaining to the idea that extraterrestrials have been manipulating our government since at least sumerian times after watching countless annunaki videos on youtube i have concluded that the idea is mostly new age pseudoscience thinking of things rationally the idea that a species that is advanced enough to travel inter galactic ally would come all the way here to engineer a slave race to mine for gold instead of simply using ai is ridiculous then deciding that their creation is so disobedient that they need to take them out with a flood it just sounds like complete mythology to me and the idea of their planet nibiru rotating around two suns in the opposite direction i feel it does not reflect accurate astronomy at all why there definitely may be a large planet beyond pluto somewhere i do not believe it is more likely to have life than any others with an atmosphere similar to earth i always consider all views but my belief is that if extra terrestrials are here already it is not related to the mainstream narrative that is portrayed to the public just my opinion other input is welcome   \n",

       "4      discussion top secret pharmaceuticals does anybody have any good sources for militarized and or elite applications of pharmaceuticals we always hear about different secret technologies that the government defense agencies are developing or sitting on whether it be direct energy weapons death rays unconventional aircraft weather modifications and the likes but i rarely hear of any theories of pharma technologies that enhance the most important resource arguably in any military the human being itself outside of the classic mkultra experiments with lsd and hypnosis and what not does anyone have any good videos or reads on different theories of potential substances that the elite mercenaries have access too shit i would be interested in any resources that discuss the top secret alteration of biology in any kind of way to enhance the warrior it seems to me that an amphetamine style stimulant with some kind of sensory enhancing but also pain numbing drug would be worth researching we really do not know the limits of pharmaceuticals i do not think it is so far fetched to believe that there is a significant chunk of the black budget that goes towards developing these kinds of things for combat uses what do you all think have any theories of your own   \n",
